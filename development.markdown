# Further Development

We hope to remain consistent with Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Community (AIRR) standards, and so should there be any changes introduced to the AIRR standards, the application will update accordingly. We are currently compatible with v1.4. We also seek to keep up to date with other immune receptor repertoire analysis tools, so additional functionalities may be added in the future.
