# LymphoSeq2_Shiny

LymphoSeq2_Shiny is an interactive web application of [LymphoSeq2](https://github.com/shashidhar22/LymphoSeq2/tree/v0.0.0.9000) built with the R/Shiny package. This Shiny application will allow you to upload Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Sequencing (AIRR-seq) data to display and perform various analytical visualizations. All graphical visualizations are available to be downloaded as PDF or RData files. All Data tables will be available to be downloaded as TSV, Excel, or RData files.

## Dependencies

All of the required packages will be automtically installed when the application is run. However, the user will need to manually install **LymphoSeq2**. Instructions are below.

### Installing LymphoSeq2

The LymphoSeq2 Shiny application is currently using a developmental version of LymphoSeq2, which will need to be downloaded from the source code. First, head to [LymphoSeq2's git repository](https://github.com/WarrenLabFH/LymphoSeq2).

1. Get a copy of LymphoSeq2 by running the following command in the terminal (in whatever directory you want this in):
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/WarrenLabFH/LymphoSeq2.git
   ```
   
2. As of June 2022, the branch v1 has the latest updates, and so this is the version of LymphoSeq2 we will be interested in installing. Run the following commands to get to v1: 

   ```
   cd LymphoSeq2
   
   git checkout v1
   ```

3. After we are in the v1 branch, we can open an R session in the LymphoSeq2 directory and download LymphoSeq2 as package with the following commands:

   ```
   radian
   
   # install the devtools package first (skip if already installed)
   install.packages("devtools")
   
   # load devtools package
   library(devtools)

   # install LymphoSeq2
   install()
   ```

## Running the Application

The **Shiny** package must first be loaded into the R session. Then, to start the application, simply execute Shiny's `runApp` function.

```
# load the Shiny package
library(shiny)

# run the application (assuming current directory is LymphoSeq2_Shiny)
runApp("LymphoSeq2_app/")
```

## Using the Application

The first step in using the application is to select files to upload. Files currently accepted are .tsv files generated by [Adaptive Biotechnologies' ImmunoSEQ assay](https://www.immunoseq.com) or RData files containing preprocessed summary tables. Once uploaded, data tables in the .tsv files will be standardized into [Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR)](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/index.html) format.
